    #           sensors using the 1 wire protocol. You'll need to add "dtoverlay=w1-gpio"
    #           to /boot/config.txt and reboot to use this on a pi, see https://github.com/libre-computer-project/libretech-wiring-tool
    #           for enabling the w1-gpio overlay on the AML-S905X-CC

    # ~60C before it begins to mechanically fail. If you print with a different material,
    # this may be increased, search for the glass transition temperature for your material.
    # Water of course also boils at 100C, and will slowly boil off somewhat below that
    # so consider something like Propylene Glycol instead of water as a heat exchanger fluid.
    # Also keep in mind the recommended thermometer (DS18S20) only supports -55 to 125C.
