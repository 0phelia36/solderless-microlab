- Mark and drill holes for straps to attach the assembly to the Reactor Unit housing
- Paint the board if desired

## Mount pumps and connecting straps
- Insert the pumps into the holes on the mounting board, fastening them securely with M3 screws
- Securely attach straps (or other connecting hardware) to the mounting board

## Connect tubing
- Connect lines that will run from the pumps to the Reactor Unit manifold input port
