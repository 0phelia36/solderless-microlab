- 3x 20mm M3 screws

### Printed parts

- Reactor manifold core
- Reactor manifold lid
- Stirring motor mount

## Reactor Core assembly

The Reactor Core houses the reaction chamber, which is where the SCIENCE happens. We're going to build the manifold, attach the stirring assembly, and put it all inside the mason jars!

### Assembling the Reactor Core Manifold

First, we need to assemble the manifold that holds the jars together and allows tubing into the reaction chamber and temperature control regions of the reactor core.

**Components:**

- Reactor Core manifold
- Reactor Core lid
- 6oz jar lid ring
- 3x 12mm M3 screws

**Assembly:**

- Place the jar lid ring over the manifold core.
- Insert the manifold core through the manifold lid, then twist the lid slightly so that the manifold core fits snugly in the manifold lid. Check to make sure the holes on the side of the manifold core line up with those on the manifold lid
- Use the 12mm M3 screws to secure the printed lid and manifold core together.

### Assembling and Attaching the Stirring Motor Mount

Next, we need to attach the stirring motor mount to the top of the manifold, secure the stirring motor in place, and connect the motor shaft to the paddle.

Please note that we are experimenting with sinking nuts into various components for more reliable and durable connections. This is why the screw holes on top of the manifold are hexagonal at the top. Doing this requires a soldering iron and a steady hand. You may also want to drill out the stirring mount screw holes with a 1/8" bit to give the screws more play to mate with the nuts.

The motor mount is in active development as of v0.6 and we thank you for patience with the rough edges.

**Components:**

- Stirring motor mount
- Stirring motor
  - Possiby necessary: Material such as dense foam to hold it in place.
- Shaft coupler to connect the motor to the stirring paddle shaft.
  - Possibly necessary: ~1" of silicone or surgical tubing to connect the shaft coupler to the stirring paddle's shaft. There are couplers that will mate various motors to the shaft, but finding them in the exact sizes required can be tricky. We have found that silicone tubing with 1mm walls and an 8mm outer diameter gives a snug fit that isn't too hard to work with.
- Stirring paddle
- 3x 20mm M3 screws

**Assembly:**

- If using tubing with the coupler:
  - Make sure that one end of the coupler is able to securely connect with the motor's shaft.
  - Push the tubing up over the other end of the shaft coupler, working it up until it is just below the set screws for the other end.
- Connect the shaft coupler to the motor's shaft using the coupler's set screws. Take care to center it as well as possible and note that the shaft is likely has a flat spot that makes it non-symmetrical
- Insert the coupler into the hole in the top of the stirring motor mount. If necessary, cut some dense foam or other padding material so that it is held firmly in place. You can use a little bit of electrical tape to secure the foam to the motor.
- Insert the mixing paddle's shaft up through the center of the Reactor Core manifold, then insert it into the bottom of the motor mount such that it slides into the coupling or tubing.
- Use the M3 screws to connect the stirring mount to the top of the manifold.
  - As mentioned above, drilling or otherwise widening the motor mount's screw holes can make this easier

## Reactor Unit reaction chamber assembly

Almost there! Now we just have to put it all together!

**Components:**

- 6oz jar and lid ring
- 32oz jar and lid ring

**Assembly**

- Place the mixing paddle in the 6oz jar and seal the lid ring.
  - If the paddle shaft is too long, you will need to cut it shorter using a hacksaw or bolt cutters.
- Place the 6oz jar inside the larger 32oz jar and seal the lid ring.

TADA! Your Reactor Core is complete!
