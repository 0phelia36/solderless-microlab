## Reactor Unit parts:

- Mixing paddle
- Mixing motor
- Reactor manifold - 3D printed mason jar lid
- Stirring motor mount - 3d printed motor and shaft holder
- Wide mouth quart Mason jar 32oz
- Regular mouth half pint Mason jar 6oz
- Tubing (5mm / 8mm) - use tubing compatible with your circulation pumps
- Housing walls, corner reinforcements, flange, and straps

## Reactor Unit housing assembly

**NOTE:** If you are following an assembly video, it will not include the Reactor Unit housing. The Temperature Control Unit circulation pump methodology in the video is also outdated.

### Reactor Unit housing parts
- 5 pieces thin plywood, cut to 8" x 8"
- Corner reinforcements 
   - We used upcycled protective corners from a shipping package 
   - Any three-corner joining hardware will work, but these are convenient with the velcro straps and allow rapid assembly and breakdown
- Light strip
- Adhesive-backed velcro patches
- Two-sided velcro to cut straps from

### Creation of housing parts 

- Cut and paint plywood
   - Depending on your corner reinforcements, you may want a different method than we used here. We intend these units to pack mostly flat for storage and shipping.
   - For this, we drilled 1/2" holes large enough for the 
   - The top face should have a hole cut just large enough to fit the top of the large mason jar through. A 3d-printed collar that securely holds the jar in place can be found in the Parts repository [https://github.com/FourThievesVinegar/Parts/tree/master/v5](https://github.com/FourThievesVinegar/Parts/tree/master/v5)
- Cut velcro straps
   - 4 long straps (~16") for the back corners (they join 3 faces of the housing)
   - 4 short straps (~6") for the front corners (they join 2 faces of the housing)
- Cut, paint, and assemble reactor housing door (use packing tape for the transparent door)
   - This unit uses sticky velcro patches to hold the door to the rest of the assembly
- Attach light strips to the inside of the top face of the housing
   - We used 12v LED strips stuck to a scrap of corrugated plastic, which attaches to the housing with adhesive velcro patches

### Assembling the housing

- Use the long velcro straps to weave the faces and corner reinforcements together
    - We used this method because breakdown and reassembly can be done easily by hand. This is useful for shipping because the plywood packs flat. If you are not intending to break down your microlab, you can use more permanent means such as screws, glue, and wooden corner reinforcements.
- Start with the bottom rear corners, then the bottom front corners, then the top rear corners, then the top front corners.

## Reactor Unit reaction chamber assembly

1. Use M3 screws to attach the motor mount to the reactor manifold.
1. Attach mixing paddle to reactor lid and motor
   1. Insert the mixing paddle (RX-PDL) up through the center hole in the reactor lid (RX-LID) and press it into place in the shaft of the mixing motor (RX-MXM).
   1. You will likely need a coupler for this. You can use surgical tubing to connect the mixing paddle shaft to the motor coupling. This component is still being refined as the current design is not optimal.
1. Screw the small mason jar (RX-COR) into the reactor lid, then slide the core into the large mason jar (RX-OUT) and screw the reactor lid down.
1. Insert the small mason jar into the hole in the top face of the Reactor Unit housing, then insert it into the large mason jar and screw in the large mason jar
    1. **NOTE:** This may be a tight fit. If your printer over-extrudes even a little, you may need to sand down the manifold so that it fits. Wigging the reactor along the loosest axis with gentle pressure (pushing to insert, pulling to remove) can help.
    1. **NOTE:** Remember that PLA absorbs moisture and may swell slightly due to exposure to the temperature control systems.
1. Once the jars are secured to the manifold, use the 3D printed flange to hold it in place. in the housing.
