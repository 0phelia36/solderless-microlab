# MicroLab Reactor Unit Assembly

These instructions assume you have already assembled the Pumps Unit and the Reactor Core.

## Parts

### Purchased Parts

- 20x 12mm M3 screws
- A 12v light with a male barrel connector plug

### Printed Parts

- All Reactor Stand pieces: H A ¢ k
- Jar flanges (thin c-shaped pieces used to hold the Reactor Core more securely)

## Assembling the Stand

**Components:**

- All Reactor Stand pieces: H A ¢ k 

**Assembly:**

- Use the M3 screws to assemble the Reactor Stand pieces in the following way:
  - The H is the left side.
  - The k is the right side.
  - The A connects them along the back. 
  - Together, the H A k units support the ¢ and the Pumps Unit.
- The H and k each have four holes that match up with the holes on the Pumps Unit
  - Note that putting nuts on these screws will require opening the Pumps Unit.
  - Developer note: we would love to use more inset nuts to make repeated disassembly easier and less prone to wear on the plastic and get loose over time. If this is something you're familiar with, please hit us up at the volunteer email listed on the website.

## Assembling the Rest of the Fucking Reactor

You've already built the core and the pump. All that's left to do is connect it all up.

**Components:**

- The Reactor Stand
- The Reactor Core
- The Pumps Unit
- 2x Reactor Core shims
- A 12v light with a male barrel connector plug

**Assembly:**

- Attach the Pumps Unit to the Reactor Stand by screwing 4x 12mm M3 screws screws into each side of the Pumps Unit.
  - NOTE: This is a place where durable connections would be good in the future. Did we mention this already?
- Place the reactor core in the center of the ¢. Place the shims between the top of the ¢ and the underside of the rim on the neck of the Reactor Core's outer jar. Two shims should keep it snugly in place. If not, consider using another shim or adding a strap.
- Plug the stirring motor's plug into the upper barrel connector socket.
- Plug the light's plug into the barrel connector socket on the underside of the ¢.
  - We used self-adhesive 12v light strips, but attaching the barrel plug connector to that requires soldering. Any 12v light powered by a male barrel plug connector will work and if you know a good one, we are open to suggestions in an email or github issue.
  - We also recommend velcroing the light(s) to the under-side of the ¢ so they can be removed for packing and storage.
- Connect the peristaltic pumps to the Reactor Core manifold's inner channels using appropriate tubing.
  - For more on this, see [MicroLab Operation](/docs/operation.md).
