## Assembling the Pumps Box
<a name="pumps"></a>

The Pumps Box has 3 Peristaltic pumps w/ stepper motors on the front that inject reagents into the Reactor Core and the 2 circulating pumps on the sides that move hot and cold fluids to control the Reactor Core's temperature. It also has plugs on the front for the stirring motor and an accessory port that can be used to power accessories like a light.

### Reactor Core Assembly

The Reactor Core houses the reaction chamber, which is where the SCIENCE happens. We're going to build the manifold, attach the stirring assembly, and put it all inside the mason jars!

#### Assembling the Reactor Core Manifold

First, we need to assemble the manifold lid that holds the jars together and allows tubing into the reaction chamber and temperature control chamber.



<IMG ALT="Reactor manifold parts" SRC="./media/reactor-unit/reactor-manifold-parts.jpg" WIDTH="400" />


<BR><BR>

**Parts:**

* Reactor manifold core (Printed) (RU-COR)
* Reactor manifold lid (Printed) (RU-LID)
* 6 oz regular mouth mason jar for core chamber (RU-COR)
* 12mm M3 screws with nuts (SP-M3S-12)
* 20mm M3 screws with nuts (SP-M3S-20)

<IMG ALT="Reactor manifold assembled" SRC="./media/reactor-unit/ru_manifold_core.png" WIDTH="200" />

<IMG ALT="Reactor manifold assembled" SRC="./media/reactor-unit/ru_manifold_lid.png" WIDTH="200" />

<BR><BR>

**Assembly:**

- Place the jar lid ring over the manifold core.
<IMG ALT="Reactor manifold parts" SRC="./media/reactor-unit/reactor-manifold-parts.jpg" WIDTH="400"/>
- Insert the manifold core through the manifold lid, then twist the lid slightly so that the manifold core fits snugly in the manifold lid.
- Check to make sure the holes on the side of the manifold core line up with those on the manifold lid
- The screwholes on sides of the lid and manifold core should be lined up, screw in the three 12mm M3 screws.

  <IMG ALT="Reactor manifold assembled" SRC="./media/reactor-unit/reactor-manifold-assembled.jpg" WIDTH="400"/>


#### Assembling and Attaching the Stirring Motor Mount

Next, we need to attach the stirring motor mount to the top of the manifold, secure the stirring motor in place, and connect the motor shaft to the paddle.

<IMG ALT="Reactor stirring assembly parts" SRC="./media/reactor-unit/reactor-stirring-assembly-parts.jpg" WIDTH="400"/>
<IMG ALT="Reactor stirring assembly assembled" SRC="./media/reactor-unit/reactor-stirring-assembly-assembled.jpg" WIDTH="400"/>




**Parts:**

* Stir rod motor (RU-SRM)
* Stir rod (RU-STR)
* Stir rod coupler (RU-SRC)
* Reducing fitting (RU-RED)
* Stir rod mount (Printed)(RU-SRM)
* Silicone tubing 8mm OD with 1mm wall, 1"
* Possibly necessary: Material such as dense foam to hold it in place.
* 20mm M3 screws with nuts (SP-M3S-20)

**Assembly:**


- **Attach stir rod motor to coupler.** Push one end of the stir rod coupler over the motor's shaft and secure it with one of the M3 screws that came with the coupler.
   - Take care to center it and be aware that the shaft likely has a flat spot that makes it non-symmetrical
   <IMG ALT="Reactor stirring assembly assembled" SRC="./media/reactor-unit/ru_coupler.png" WIDTH="50"/>
- **Attach tubing.** Push the tubing up over the other end of the shaft coupler, working it up until it is just below the set screws for the other end.
- **Insert coupler into mount.** Insert the coupler into the hole in the top of the stirring motor mount.
- **Insert stir rod into manifold** From the bottom of Reactor Core manifold insert the mixing paddle's shaft through the center.
- **Connect stir rod to mount.** Take the stirring motor mount and insert the stir rod's shaft until it slides into the coupling tubing.
- **Attach the mount to the manifold.** Use the M3 screws to connect the stirring mount to the top of the manifold.

### Reactor Unit reaction chamber assembly

Almost there! Now we just have to put it all together!

**Parts:**

- 6oz Mason jar
- 32oz Mason jar and lid ring

**Assembly:**

- Lower the stir rod into the 6oz jar, seating the manifold lid on top of the jar. Screw the lid ring that is attached to the manifold on to the jar
  - If the stir rod shaft is too long, you will need to remove the it from the manifold, cut it shorter using a hacksaw or bolt cutters, and then reattach it.
- Place the 6oz jar inside the larger 32oz jar, slide the 32oz jar lid ring over top the manifold and screw it onto the jar.

TADA! Your Reactor Core is complete!

- Use the M3 screws to assemble the Reactor Stand pieces in the following way:
  - **Connect H and A**
    -  Place the H on the left, tilted up in its left side, the top "arms" of the H at the back should have 2 slots.
    - Place the A at the back tilted on its left side so the "feet" of the A line up with the top of the H.
    <IMG ALT="Reactor stand assembled" SRC="./media/pumps-unit/ru_stand_h.png" WIDTH="200"/>
      <IMG ALT="Reactor stand assembled" SRC="./media/pumps-unit/ru_stand_a.png" WIDTH="190"/>
    -  Slide the hooks on the A into the slots on H

  - **Connect the A and K**
    - A is already positioned
    - Place the K on the right, tilt it up on its left side so A can hook into the two slots on the K.

      <IMG ALT="Reactor stand assembled" SRC="./media/pumps-unit/ru_stand_k.png" WIDTH="200"/>

  - **Connect the Â¢ to the H and K**
      - Position the Â¢ between the H and K with the empty space of the C opening at the front. The Â¢ is attached at the top, the two hooks on either end of the Â¢ will line up with the 2 slots on the H and an on the K.

### Reactor Unit - Putting it All Together

You've already built the core and the pump. All that's left to do is connect it all up.

**Components:**

* Reactor Stand
* Reactor Core
* Pumps Unit
* Jar Flanges (Printed) (RU-RJF)


**Assembly:**

- **Attach the Pumps box to the Reactor Stand.**
  - Take the Pumps Box and insert the tabs on H, Â¢ , and K

  <IMG ALT="Reactor stand assembled" SRC="./media/pumps-unit/ru_stand_assembled.png" WIDTH="200"/>

- **Attach the Reactor Core**
  * Place the Reactor Core in the center of the Â¢.
  * Add the jar flanges (C shaped pieces) as shims in between the top of the Â¢ part and the Reactor Core's outer jar. Two flanges should keep it snugly in place. If not, consider using another shim. (See picture below for reference, the jar flanges are orange and the Â¢ piece is yellow.)


- **Connecting Reactor Core to Pumps Box**
  * Plug the stirring motor's plug into the upper barrel connector socket on the Pumps Box.
  * Attach one piece of tubing to each of the the peristaltic pumps and through the holes in the Reactor Core manifold to reach the 6oz mason jar chamber.
