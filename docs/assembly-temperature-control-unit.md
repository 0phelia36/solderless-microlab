# Microlab Temperature Control Unit Assembly

![Temperature Control Unit](/docs/media/microlab-temperature-control-unit.jpg)

## Temperature Control Unit parts
- Circulation Pump(s)
- Tubing to and from the jacketed portion of the reactor
- Beverage heater coil (2 recommended for faster heating)
- 2-Gang electrical box and face plate
- GFCI Outlet
- 6oz Canning jar (NOTE: Using a larger jar with the pumps submerged inside may be necessary for priming, but submerging the pumps has impacts on their heat tolerances)
- Relay (Must support mains power!)
- Inlet power module with fuse
- Quick disconnect electrical connectors
- AC power cord

## Assembly
The Temperature Control Unit has two major parts: The Power Box and the Heat Exchanger. 

### Power Box
- Connect the inlet power module to the GFCI outlet with the relay between them (it doesn't matter whether the relay is on the positive or negative side)
   - NOTE: Carefully consult the wiring instructions for the Inlet and be familiar with basic safety and wiring with mains power. We cannot stress enough that this is the most dangerous part of the Microlab itself. We highly recommend that you cover all exposed terminals with electrical tape and wrap it thorouthly.
   - Use the quick disconnect connectors.
- Connect the GFCI ground to the Inlet's ground connection.
- Put it all in the 2-gang electrical housing.
   - Screw the GFCI outlet securely into the housing
   - Cut a hole in a decora blank to fit the power inlet and drill smaller holes to allow your three wire connector's leads inside the box.
   - Attach the power inlet to the blank securely by drilling through the blank/decora plate. Use small M3 screws.
- Connect the relay to the positive, negative, and signal wires on your three-wire connector. Wrap a zip tie or copius electrical tape around the leads to prevent them from getting yanked and disconnecting.
- Screw the 2-gang plate onto the 2-gang housing

### Heat Exchanger
**TODO: More details**

The Heat Exchanger designs are undergoing finalization as of this writing. Draft instructions are as follows:
- Use the 3D printed hot jar lid or cut a metal jar lid with the following:
    - Two round holes: one for the intake and one for the exhaust tube.
    - One rectangular hole that holds the heating coils to the lid. Leave the flap from this hole and use the excess material as a strap to hold the heaters in place (TODO: Pic)
    - Be careful of sharp edges if you are cutting metal! Fold them flat and always bend corners back to avoid sharp points that may cut you or future users!
- Bend copper tubing into a helix that will fit in the heat exchanger jar while still leaving space for the heating coils
    - It is OK if the copper tubing and heating coils touch.
    - The more copper tubing you can fit, the more heat will be exchanged.
- Attach silicone tubing to the circulation pump and the intake and exhaust of the coiled copper tubing. Run the open ends into the outter jar of the Reactor Unit. Make sure they will reach below the water level there.
- As of writing, we are experimenting with length of copper, number of heat coils, and heat exchanger jar volume to see what is optimal. If you are knowledgable in thermo-fluid engineering or are experimenting with this, we would love to hear from you.
