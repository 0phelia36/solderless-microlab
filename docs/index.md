# Welcome to The MicroLab

<IMG ALT="The MicroLab assembled" SRC="./media/MicroLab_assembled.jpeg" width="800" />

The MicroLab is part of the MicroLad Suite. Learn more about the hardware/software stack [here](/docs/motivation.md#Meet-the-MicroLab-Suite)



The MicroLab is made up of:
* Control Unit - Runs the software and hardware
* Heating Unit - Heats the liquid that circulates outside the reactor to warm it
* Cooling Unit - Cools the liquid that circulates outside the reactor to cool it
* Reactor Unit - Reactor core and pumps box assemebled together
   * Reactor core - made of of the inner chamber where compounds are made, outer chamber where liquid circualtes to warm or cool the inner chmaber, thermistor to take temperature in the inner chamber, stir rod  to mix things in the inner chmaber, and the parts to mount and hold all the pieces together
   * Pumps Box - houses the circulating pumps, peristaltic pumps and two ports, one for the stir rod and one as an accessory port.

### Printed Parts
<a name="3d"></a>

The MicroLab uses several custom parts Part of the this 3D printed parts [Github repo](https://github.com/FourThievesVinegar/microlab-parts/tree/master/v6)

All cases and housings are 3D printed. The Control Unit box and lid are designed to support all components and ports that comprise the unit.
