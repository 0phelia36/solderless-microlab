# MicroLab Wiring Guide

The most important part of wiring is to be consistent through out the circuit.


###  **8-pin Wire Order:**
<a name="wireorder"></a>
Important note: This where the order of wires for one of your cables is determined!
 It's important to maintain the same wiring order throughout the project.

 The 8-pin connector passes 12V along to the Accessory port (Acc), Stir rod (Stir), Cooling pump (Cool), and Heating pump (Heat) wires.

**8-pin connector - external & cable**
If looking at the connector from outside the case, from left to right the wires will go:
* Heat negative (-), blue
* Heat positive (+), blue
* Cool negative (-), red
* Cool positive (+), red
* Stir negative (-), green
* Stir positive (+), green
* Accesory negative (-), black
* Accessory positive (+), black

This is the same order for placing the wires at the back of the 8-pin socket for MicroLab cable.

**8-pin connector - internal**
From inside the case the 8pin connector wiring order will look like this:

#### **Wiring the 8-pin connector**
We will attach the positive wires (color coded) and negative wires to the 8-pin connector socket (SP-PC8) first.
* The connectors have 3 pieces: socket, mount plate and plug.

  - **Wiring the Positives.** Take one of the 8-pin connector sockets and from the back use a small screwdriver to loosen the 8 screw terminals. Working left to right, insert the 4" black, green, red, blue wires into the correct positive (+) terminals and tighten the terminals. Use the photo below or the [wiring order](/docs/microlab-wiring.md) page to confirm placement.
     - Don't overtighten the screw terminal. Once done you should be able to lightly tug on the wires without them moving.

  #### **Wire Order** <a name="wireorder"></a>
  Please read and get comfortable with the wiring order explained on the [MicroLab Wiring](/docs/microlab-wiring.md) page. It's important to maintain the same wiring order throughout the project.

  **12-pin connector - internal**.
  The 12-pin connector passes 12V to the three peristaltic pumps. When looking at the pumps mounted to their box from left to right we'll call them X, Y and Z.
