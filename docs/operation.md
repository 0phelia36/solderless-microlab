# Operating the MicroLab

## Setting it up

This section describes how to assemble a complete but disassembled MicroLab. If you need to build one from scratch, see: [assembly.md](assembly.md)

**TODO: instructions for this and other sections:**

- Assembly of modules and Reactor Unit housing.
  - Assembling the Reactor Stand
  - Assembling the rest of the Reactor Unit
- Plugging in the cables.
- Setup of heating and cooling.
- Adding water to the Temperature Control Unit.
- Connecting the tubes
- Pre-warming the warm reservoir (get it hot and insulated ahead of time)

## Writing recipes

You can go to [apothecarium.fourthievesvinegar.org](https://apothecarium.fourthievesvinegar.org/) to create recipes. You can also start [a project in Vinni](https://vinni.fourthievesvinegar.org/projects/NVXg2yPAKaMu) and save your recipes that way. More on this as Vinni approaches a real release and our services get integrated.
