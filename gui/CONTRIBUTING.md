# Solderless Microlab Gui

This sub-project is a yarn project that uses the following for development:

`semantic-ui-react` - a package that creates semantic UI components such as [buttons](https://react.semantic-ui.com/elements/button/) and [lists](https://react.semantic-ui.com/elements/list/). Please use these components whenever appropriate.
`prettier` - we use Prettier to keep formatting consistent across files and authors. Your IDE probably has an extension for it. Please auto-format on save.
